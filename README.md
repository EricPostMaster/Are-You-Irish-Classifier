# Measuring "Irish-ness" with the Murphy Index

By comparing average log predicted probabilities of name ngrams being Irish to the "benchmark" Irish surname "Murphy", we can create a tongue-in-cheek "Irish-ness" score just in time for St. Patrick's Day!

For example, if the average log predicted probability of the name "Murphy" is -6.58, and the average log predicted probability of "Bailey" is -7.762, then the Murphy Index would be (-6.58/-7.762)\*-100 =  84.77. A bonnie lovely Murphy score, I'd say! :)
